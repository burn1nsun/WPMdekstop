WPMdesktop WPM calculator

WPMdesktop is a program that calculates your WPM from anywhere with the freedom of being able to type whatever you want. Other features include being able to see your WPM live from the sleek traymenu, and being able to calculate your WPM quite accurately even over long periods of time which may need a lot of pausing for thought during idletimes. Wheter you want to count your from a certain time period, or until you hit a certain word amount, WPMdesktop is definitely a nifty application for people that enjoy putting their typing skills to the test.

Currently its only limited to the US layout when displaying the input, although that does not affect WPM, it only affects the symbols inserted, for example EST layout "Ã•" results in "]" in the US layout.
